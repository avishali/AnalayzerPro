VERIFIER PROMPT

You are verifying RMS_BALLISTICS_TUNING_V1

TEST MATRIX:

Test 1 — Transient Separation
	•	Play drum loop
	•	Observe:
	•	Peak jumps immediately
	•	RMS rises slowly and smoothly
PASS if RMS never spikes to Peak height

Test 2 — Hold Isolation
	•	Enable Peak Hold
	•	RMS must continue moving
PASS if RMS ignores Hold entirely

Test 3 — Silence Falloff
	•	Stop audio
	•	RMS should decay slowly, not snap down
PASS if decay takes >200ms visually

Test 4 — Mode Stability
	•	Switch FFT sizes (1024 → 8192)
	•	RMS feel must remain consistent
PASS if no timing change is perceived

Test 5 — Multi-Trace Consistency
	•	Enable L, R, Mid, Side
	•	All RMS traces must share same smoothing behavior
PASS if no trace feels “faster” or “twitchy”

⸻

FAILURE CONDITIONS
	•	RMS visually tracks Peak
	•	RMS freezes during Hold
	•	RMS flickers between frames
	•	CPU usage increases noticeably
	•	Any trace disappears or flattens

⸻

SUCCESS CRITERIA

RMS should feel:
	•	Calm
	•	Heavy
	•	Trustworthy
	•	“Mastering-grade”

If it feels like a VU meter layered onto a spectrum — mission is successful.
