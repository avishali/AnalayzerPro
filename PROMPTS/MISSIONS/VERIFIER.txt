Verification steps:
1) Confirm RTADisplay.h no longer contains a by-value member of RenderConfigKey before the full struct definition.
2) Clean build the standalone target (and any plugin targets if present).
3) Confirm no other files were modified besides RTADisplay.h.
Outcome must be PASS if build succeeds.
