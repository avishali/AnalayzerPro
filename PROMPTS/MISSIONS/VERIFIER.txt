Mission ID: SIDE_TRACE_SMOOTHING_AND_SMOOTHING_SWITCH_FIX_V1

Verifier Goal
Confirm SIDE is smoothed when smoothing is enabled, and smoothing option switching is artifact-free.

Code Verification
	1.	SIDE smoothing wired

	•	Find the smoothing application point.
	•	Confirm SIDE passes through it when smoothing != Off.
PASS if: SIDE uses smoothed buffer when smoothing enabled; raw buffer when Off.

	2.	Smoothing change resets state

	•	Confirm there is explicit handling when smoothing param changes:
	•	reset smoothing processor state OR generation mechanism
	•	invalidate caches for smoothed traces
PASS if: change handling exists and affects SIDE at minimum.

	3.	Render guards

	•	Confirm renderer checks buffer sizes (numBins) and avoids drawing mismatched buffers.
PASS if: no “use stale vector size” risk remains.

Runtime Verification

Test A — Side-only smoothing
	•	Enable Side trace only.
	•	Cycle smoothing options rapidly while audio plays.
Expected:
	•	SIDE remains visible, no partial curves, no vertical drop artifacts.

Test B — Multi-trace smoothing switching
	•	Enable several traces including Side.
	•	Change smoothing options.
Expected:
	•	No trace corruption; all traces update coherently.

Test C — FFT size + smoothing
	•	With smoothing enabled, change FFT size 2048/4096/8192.
Expected:
	•	Side remains correct; no artifacts.

Report
Write VERIFIER_RESULT.md with PASS/FAIL for:
	•	Side smoothing applied
	•	Smoothing switch stability
	•	FFT size interaction
If FAIL: specify exact missing reset/guard and the minimal fix.
