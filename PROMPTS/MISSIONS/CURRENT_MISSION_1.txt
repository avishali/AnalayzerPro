Mission: MULTI_TRACE_DUALFFT_V1 — PHASE 3 (Option B: L/R only)

Goal:
Visually validate dual FFT by rendering an L trace (and optionally R) in addition to existing Peak (yellow) and RMS (blue).
Do NOT implement Mono/Mid/Side yet.

Hard constraints:
- Minimal diffs (~85 lines target).
- No allocations in paint().
- No audio-thread changes.
- Do NOT modify computeFFT().
- STOP after each step and report.

Scope (ONLY):
- Source/ui/analyzer/AnalyzerDisplayView.cpp
- Source/ui/analyzer/RTADisplay.h
- Source/ui/analyzer/RTADisplay.cpp

Design (LOCKED):
- Use existing snapshot.powerL / snapshot.powerR.
- Convert to dB using the same scale/mapping as current peak/RMS.
- Colors:
  - Peak: existing yellow (unchanged)
  - RMS: existing blue (unchanged)
  - L trace: green (e.g., 0xff00c853)
  - R trace (optional): magenta (e.g., 0xffd81b60)
- Traces controlled by existing toggles:
  - showL → L trace
  - showR → R trace

Execution:

STEP 3B.1 — Pass L/R data into RTADisplay
- In AnalyzerDisplayView.cpp, where snapshot is applied:
  - Add calls like:
      rtaDisplay.setLData(snapshot.powerL)
      rtaDisplay.setRData(snapshot.powerR)
- Feature-flagged by enableMultiTrace_ if necessary.
STOP and report.

STEP 3B.2 — Extend RTADisplay API
- In RTADisplay.h:
  - Add members to store L/R power spans or references.
  - Add setters: setLData(...), setRData(...).
STOP and report.

STEP 3B.3 — Render L/R traces
- In RTADisplay::paint():
  - After Peak/RMS rendering, check:
      if (traceConfig.showL) → render L trace
      if (traceConfig.showR) → render R trace
  - Use the same decimation + path stroke pipeline as peak/RMS.
  - No allocations.
STOP and report.

STEP 3B.4 — Visual sanity test
Test signals:
A) Left-only sine:
   - L trace strong
   - R trace near floor
B) Right-only sine:
   - Opposite
C) Stereo identical:
   - L and R traces overlap
Deliverable:
- Files changed
- Test results
STOP.
