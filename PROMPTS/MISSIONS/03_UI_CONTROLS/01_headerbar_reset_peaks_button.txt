# TODO
# Paste the Cursor prompt text for this task here.
- PRs should describe:
  - What prompt was applied
  - Why the change exists
  - Any known follow-ups

---

## When in Doubt

If you are unsure about:
- RT safety
- Which subsystem a change belongs to
- Whether a prompt already exists
- Whether a refactor is appropriate

**Stop and ask before proceeding.**

One good question is always preferred over one bad diff.

## Final Note

This system exists to keep AnalyzerPro:
- Stable
- Predictable
- Pleasant to work on
- Safe for real-time audio use

Thank you for respecting it.
