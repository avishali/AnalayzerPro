TASK: Theme variant readiness (no runtime UI yet)

This task will be split into MULTIPLE prompts.
DO NOT implement everything at once.

Phase 1:
	•	Ensure mdsp_ui::UiContext / ThemeVariant exists and is used consistently.
	•	Ensure no UI component directly instantiates Theme or relies on “dark-only assumptions” in code paths.

Out of scope for this prompt:
	•	Adding an in-plugin toggle/menu to switch themes.
	•	Persisting theme choice.
	•	Loading tokens from JSON/Figma export.

Scope:
	•	third_party/melechdsp-hq/shared/mdsp_ui/include/mdsp_ui/Theme.h
	•	third_party/melechdsp-hq/shared/mdsp_ui/src/Theme.cpp (ONLY if needed)
	•	Source/PluginEditor.h
	•	Source/PluginEditor.cpp

Rules:
	•	Stop after Phase 1 is complete.
	•	Minimal diffs; do not introduce new modules.

Acceptance:
	•	AnalyzerPro compiles with UiContext defaulting to Dark.
	•	All UI code can support Light later by swapping tokens, with no further refactors required.
