# TODO
# Paste the Cursor prompt text for this task here.
This keeps active prompts clean and auditable.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- **Do NOT** redefine classes in `.cpp` files
- **Do NOT** rewrite entire files unless explicitly instructed
- **Do NOT** allocate on the audio thread
- **Do NOT** mix UI logic into AnalyzerEngine
- **Do NOT** guess when instructions are unclear

If a prompt contradicts existing architecture:
> STOP. Ask for clarification.

## Why This Exists

This project:
- Has real-time DSP constraints
- Is expected to live for years
- Must remain stable under heavy iteration

These prompts are not bureaucracy — they are how we:
- Avoid regressions
- Preserve intent
- Keep agents useful instead of dangerous

## For New Contributors

If you are new to this repo:
1. Read this file
2. Read `PROMPTS_INDEX.md`
3. Start with a small prompt
4. Ask before making structural changes

---

## Questions?

If you are unsure:
- Which subsystem a change belongs to
- Whether a change is RT-safe
- Whether a prompt already exists

Ask first.  
We prefer **one good question** over **one bad diff**.
