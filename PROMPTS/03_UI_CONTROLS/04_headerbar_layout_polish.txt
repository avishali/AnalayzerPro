TASK: UI layout stabilization (HeaderBar + ControlRail sizing)

Subsystem:
    • HeaderBar / ControlRail / MainView layout

Scope:
    • Source/ui/layout/HeaderBar.cpp
    • Source/ui/layout/ControlRail.h
    • Source/ui/layout/ControlRail.cpp
    • Source/ui/MainView.cpp

Rules:
    • Layout only: no visual style changes.
    • Keep paint() cheap and allocation-free.
    • No DSP/threading changes.
    • Minimal diffs.

Goals:
    1) Fix HeaderBar controls going out of bounds at common window sizes.
    2) Keep Mode + FFT size + Averaging in the top header zone and visible.
    3) Ensure ControlRail content fits with no overlaps/clipping.
    4) Normalize spacing across HeaderBar/ControlRail/FooterBar (use shared metrics).

Acceptance:
    • No controls out of bounds at min size or typical larger sizes.
    • All APVTS parameters already present remain visible in the UI.
    • Build passes with no new warnings.
