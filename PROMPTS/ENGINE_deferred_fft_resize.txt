TASK: Make FFT size changes RT-safe (defer allocations off audio thread)

Scope (ONLY):
- Source/analyzer/AnalyzerEngine.h
- Source/analyzer/AnalyzerEngine.cpp
- The existing UI message-thread tick that already pulls snapshots (e.g. a timer callback) to apply pending resize

Rules:
- Do NOT allocate, resize, make_unique, or lock on the audio thread.
- Do NOT modify JUCE sources.
- Minimal diff; no refactors.

Goal:
- FFT size changes requested from the audio thread are applied on the message thread.
- UI holds last valid frame until the new FFT is ready.

Implementation (high-level):
1) Add atomics in AnalyzerEngine:
   - pendingFftSize_ (int)
   - fftResizeRequested_ (bool)
2) Implement request API:
   - requestFftSize(int): stores pending size + sets requested flag (no allocations)
3) Implement apply API:
   - applyPendingFftSizeIfNeeded(): message-thread only; performs initializeFFT() and clears flag
4) Ensure applyPendingFftSizeIfNeeded() is called from a message-thread timer (never from processBlock).
5) Keep existing snapshot publish/read logic intact; do not introduce locks.

Deliverable:
- Build passes, no RT allocations, FFT size updates within next UI tick.
