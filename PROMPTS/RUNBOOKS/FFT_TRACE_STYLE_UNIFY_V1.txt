MISSION_ID: FFT_TRACE_STYLE_UNIFY_V1

GOAL
Make ALL traces (RMS, Stereo, L, R, Mono, Mid, Side) use the same “silk” rendering quality as Peak:
- same quadratic smoothing option
- same rounded joins/caps
- same multi-pass (glow+core) at least
Peak can still get highlight pass; others can be glow+core only.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Render-only. Do not change FFT data or smoothing math.
- No allocations in paint().
- Minimal diffs.

FILES ALLOWED
- Source/ui/analyzer/RTADisplay.cpp
- Source/ui/analyzer/RTADisplay.h (only if needed)

IMPLEMENTER

STEP 1 — Identify Peak draw path
Find the exact function/branch where Peak is drawn:
- drawSilkTrace(...)
- useQuadraticSmoothing
- buildTracePath with quadratic segments
Record what Peak uses.

STEP 2 — Make all other traces use the same path builder
For each non-peak trace:
- Ensure it uses the SAME path construction method as Peak (quadratic smoothing ON).
- Ensure it uses the SAME stroke style: PathStrokeType(curved, rounded caps).

STEP 3 — Apply silk stroke helper consistently
If you have drawSilkTrace():
- call it for RMS and all L/R/M/S/Mono traces too.
- For non-peak traces: skip the highlight pass (or pass isPeak=false).

STEP 4 — Confirm no per-frame allocations
Paths must be:
- stack paths OR member scratchPath cleared and rebuilt
No vector resizing in paint.

STOP and write IMPLEMENTER_RESULT.md with:
- Which traces were changed to use the peak-style builder
- Confirm paint does not allocate

VERIFIER

CHECK A
Enable Side only + RMS only:
- PASS if curves are rounded like Peak (no stair steps).

CHECK B
FFT sizes: 1024/2048/4096/8192:
- PASS if smoothness consistent, no regression.

Write VERIFIER_RESULT.md and STOP.
