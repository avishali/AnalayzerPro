MISSION_ID: FFT_TRACE_TOGGLE_ATOMIC_REBUILD_V1

GOAL
When toggling any trace ON/OFF:
- The curve appears fully formed immediately (no “left-to-right drawing”).
- No partial paths or one-frame garbage.
- No flicker.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Render stability only. No FFT math changes.
- No allocations in paint().
- Minimal diffs.

FILES ALLOWED
- Source/ui/analyzer/RTADisplay.cpp
- Source/ui/analyzer/RTADisplay.h (if adding small state)

IMPLEMENTER

STEP 1 — Add path-cache validity
Add:
- bool pathsValid = false;
- uint32 pathGen = 0;
- uint32 lastBuiltGen = 0;

Increment pathGen when:
- any trace toggle changes
- smoothing changes
- bins change
- new data arrives that changes displayed traces

STEP 2 — Rebuild paths only when dirty
In update tick (preferred) or just before drawing (still ok), do:
if (!pathsValid || lastBuiltGen != pathGen) rebuildAllPaths();

rebuildAllPaths must:
- clear each trace path fully
- build complete path for all enabled traces in one call
- set lastBuiltGen = pathGen
- set pathsValid = true

STEP 3 — Paint must never draw partial
In paint():
- if (!pathsValid) return (draw grid only)

STOP and write IMPLEMENTER_RESULT.md with:
- what increments pathGen
- where rebuildAllPaths runs
- proof that paint does not draw partial

VERIFIER

CHECK A
Toggle Side ON/OFF repeatedly while audio plays:
- PASS if it appears/disappears instantly (no left-to-right buildup).

CHECK B
Toggle 5 traces ON at once:
- PASS if all appear instantly and stable.

Write VERIFIER_RESULT.md and STOP.
