# AI Governance Policy

## Purpose
This document defines how Artificial Intelligence tools (ChatGPT, Cursor, and similar agents) are permitted to be used in this repository.

The goal is to:
- Enable AI as a productivity multiplier
- Prevent architectural drift
- Preserve real-time, hardware-safe, and production-grade guarantees
- Maintain clear human accountability

AI is allowed **only** when governed by explicit process.

---

## Governing Documents (Required Reading)

The following documents collectively define AI usage in this repository:

1. **[`SOP.md`](../SOP.md)**  
   Defines the mandatory Architecture → Implementation workflow.

2. **[`docs/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`](./HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md)**  
   Defines the required instruction format for AI implementation agents.

3. **`Cursor System Prompt`**  
   Enforces SOP compliance and scope discipline at execution time.

4. **Pull Request Template**  
   Requires disclosure, scope declaration, and Handoff linkage.

These documents are mutually reinforcing. None may be bypassed.

## Approved AI Roles

### ChatGPT — Architecture & Review
Allowed responsibilities:
- System and module architecture
- Interface and contract design
- Migration planning
- Code review and risk analysis
- Documentation drafting

Disallowed responsibilities:
- Direct implementation without a handoff
- Silent scope expansion
- Mixing design and execution

---

### Cursor (or Equivalent) — Implementation Agent
Allowed responsibilities:
- Mechanical code changes
- Scoped refactors defined by a Handoff Package
- CMake updates when explicitly instructed

Disallowed responsibilities:
- Inventing APIs or abstractions
- Refactoring beyond defined scope
- Making architectural decisions
- “Improving” code without instruction

Cursor must refuse work without a valid Handoff Package.

---

## Mandatory Workflow Summary

1. **Intent Definition (Human)**
   - Define objective, constraints, scope

2. **Architecture Design (ChatGPT)**
   - Produce system boundaries and contracts

3. **Handoff Package Creation**
   - Must use `HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`

4. **Implementation (Cursor)**
   - Execute instructions exactly
   - Stop on ambiguity

5. **Validation & Review**
   - Human review
   - SOP compliance check

6. **Freeze & Document**
   - When interfaces stabilize

Skipping any step violates policy.

---

## Pull Request Requirements

All non-trivial PRs must:
- Link to a completed Handoff Package
- Declare file scope (touched + forbidden)
- Confirm SOP compliance
- Disclose AI usage

PRs may be rejected **without code review** if governance requirements are not met.

---

## Real-Time & Hardware Safety Rules

AI-assisted changes must preserve:
- No allocations, locks, or blocking I/O on the audio thread
- Thread-safety assumptions
- Deterministic behavior
- Stable public interfaces

Any uncertainty requires escalation before implementation.

---

## Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- PR rejection
- Request for architectural rework
- Temporary suspension of AI usage on the repository

Repeated violations indicate misuse of AI tooling.

---

## Philosophy

AI is treated as:
- A junior implementation engineer
- A powerful drafting tool
- A reviewer assistant

AI is **not**:
- A system architect
- A decision-maker
- A substitute for engineering judgment

Architecture is intentional.  
Implementation is mechanical.  
Accountability remains human.

---

## Amendments

This policy may evolve as tooling and workflows mature.  
Changes require explicit approval and documentation updates.
